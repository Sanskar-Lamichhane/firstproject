        <!-- this is the content of comparision between navigation bar of referenced website and our website -->
        <p class="describe">
            A website's navigation bar serves as a crucial element in providing an
            easy experience for their users. It allows visitors to
            navigate and access different sections and pages of the website with feasibility.
            While designing the navigation bar for our website, we found inspiration
            in the <a href="https://www.keh.com/shop/shopby" style="color:red;"> www.keh.com </a> website. Their
            navigation bar caught our attention for its visually
            appealing design and user-friendly layout. We used it as a reference in building our own
            website for our solving our compatability issue.<br>

            One of the changes we made was removing the search button. We found that
            the navigation bar was more simple without it, and that users were
            able to find what they were looking for by browsing through the
            navigation links that we put over there. We also created our own login and sign-up buttons
            with unique colors and hover effects to make it stand out and be easily
            which can be easily recognized by users. Additionally, we added our own logo to make our own brand
            as well as to make more personalized wesbite name. Another modification we made was the change in backgournd
            image
            where we put different image as compared to reference website.<br>

            Our final product is a navigation bar that is simple, attractive and
            user-friendly, and usually seems like the common product in the market.
            According to the feedback of users, we found to know that this navigation bar
            looks minimalistic and more simple to understand so that users can easily navigate to different
            pages from the nav bar.

            A product summary on a home page is a concise and informative description of a specific product
            or a selection of products. It serves as a brief overview that highlights the key features, benefits,
            and value propositions of the product(s) being promoted. The purpose of a product summary is to capture
            the attention of visitors and entice them to explore further or make a purchase.

            We have taken this concept from the <a href="https://www.keh.com/shop/shopby" style="color:red;">
                www.keh.com </a>
            website where there is illustration of product category, but we slighly change to product items directly
            instead of writing porduct categorities for solving the compatibily issue of the consumers.

        <p class="describe">
            The footer of a website is an important aspect of web design that helps
            users easily access important information and navigate the site without
            extensive browsing. It is an essential component of any website and
            should be designed with that in mind. For our own website, we created a
            simple yet effective footer design that provides visitors with the
            necessary information and facilitates quick navigation.<br>

            During the design process, we looked at various other websites to gather
            inspiration. We found the footer of the website "<a href="https://www.keh.com/shop/shopby"
                style="color:red;"> www.keh.com </a>
            wesbsite to be particularly well-designed and visually appealing. We were
            impressed by its clean, minimalist design and its ability to present a
            lot of information in a clear and organized manner. As a result, we
            decided to use this websbite as a reference when creating our own footer.<br>

            We made a few modifications to the design to make it more suitable for
            our website. For example, we added feedback form where users can constantly write message to us
            which can lead us to update and modify website through their suggestions and complains, but
            in the reference website there are no any feeback forms. At the same time , we have not added any options
            included in the navbar here in the footer as we can go the the diiferent pages by clicking the links
            in the navbar.<br>
